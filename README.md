# SortThemCobbles
Plugin for bukkit based Minecraft servers.

SortThemCobbles is a plugin that allows players to sort their inventory and chests.

Main commands are:

/stc - works as help, messages a player list of available commands and what do they do.

/stc inventory - enables sorting inventory

/stc chest - enables sorting chests

The sorting itself is done by pressing the middle mouse button while in the inventory or chest.

There is currently a bug in a game that when you sort chest it will be sorted after reopening it. There seems to be no such bug while sorting inventory.
